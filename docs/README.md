# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub. This comprehensive collection of guides and resources provides everything you need to understand and implement OctoAcme's project management methodology, whether you're onboarding as a new team member or seeking ongoing reference material.

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on a foundation of customer-first principles, iterative delivery, and clear ownership. Our methodology emphasizes delivering small, testable increments while maintaining psychological safety and making data-informed decisions. Each project follows a structured lifecycle from initiation through retrospective, with clearly defined roles including Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risk, Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers who implement features, QA/Testing who validate quality, and Stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals. Key artifacts such as project charters, roadmaps, acceptance criteria, risk registers, and retrospective notes ensure transparency and alignment throughout the project lifecycle.

The execution workflow centers on regular team rhythms including daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and sprint reviews, supported by a pull request workflow that emphasizes small PRs, automated testing, and peer review. Quality assurance is integrated throughout with unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests, and security scanning in CI. Communication follows a structured cadence with weekly PM and Product Manager syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates, while risk management maintains a living risk register that tracks impact, likelihood, ownership, and mitigation strategies for all identified risks and dependencies.

Our release and deployment process standardizes how features reach production, with clear pre-release requirements including passing CI and security scans, documented rollback plans, and comprehensive smoke tests. Following each release or significant milestone, teams conduct retrospectives to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous improvement that measures impact and celebrates progress through small, iterative changes.
